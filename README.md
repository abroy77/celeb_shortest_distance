# Celeb Search
A CLI tool to find the shortest path between two movie stars.

### Usage
1. Compile using:

        cargo build --release 

2. Run using:
    
        ./target/release/celeb_search <path_to_data> 

For the `<path_to_data>` One should use `data/new_small/` for testing and `data/new_large/` for the final run.


### Data
There are 3 .csv files in data/new_large. These are:
1. actors.csv
2. movies.csv
3. connections.csv

It is sourced from [CS50â€™s Introduction to Artificial Intelligence with Python](https://cs50.harvard.edu/ai/2023/projects/0/degrees/)

### Movies
Contains a unique ID, title, and year of release for each movie.
